# Explanation
This is my second CRUD app and my first time using useEffect and an API. To better learn these skills, I decided to make \
this application which, given a category, generates a random excuse from the Excuser API. I chose this API because it provided \
simple information and was free. I didn't use any components for this project since I felt that it was too simple to necesitate \
having to split it and since nothing is "reused". I also added a little "animation" evertime an excuse is picked.
